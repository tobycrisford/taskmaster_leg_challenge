            <div class="intro">
                This game is based on Taskmaster Series 18 Episode 4.
                You each have a herd of 6 animals. You are trying to get the total number of legs in your herd to equal the target value.
                Each turn, you pick an animal to give to the other player. They simultaneously pick an animal to give to you.
                The first player to reach the target wins.<br><br>
                Click on an animal in your herd to give it to the computer player. The computer does not know your decision when it decides which animal to give to you.
                If it looks like nothing is happening when you click one of your animals, then either the game has ended, or the computer is giving you an identical animal back!
